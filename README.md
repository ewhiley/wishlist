## Description of project

This section provides an outline of project, including the purpose, functionality and features.

### Problem definition / purpose

The purpose of this project was to build a two-sided marketplace in Ruby on Rails. 

We chose to create an eBay style app that solves some of the issues we identified with eBay. Below are some of the issues and the ways we sought to solve them with our app. 

Issues with eBay| Proposed solution with our app |
---------|----------|
 Buyers and sellers find it hard to find each other in a sea of products and users | We implemented a matching system that allows buyers to list what they want and be matched with available products as they come on sale. | 
 Ugly, difficult to use interface | We  tried to make our interface as simple and easy to use as possible| 
Buying and selling isn't always fast or seamless and can be quite annoying, especially for sellers | We simplified the buying process with a quick pay-by-card solution - no bidding or negotiating. |

### Functionality / features
Our app includes the following functionality/features:

Users can: 
- browse and purchase products
- sign in, set up a profile, edit profile
- list and edit products to sell, including image upload
- list a wishlist
- view their wishlist matches and purchase
- view their sales an purchase history

The app includes the following features:
- Secure payment with Stripe
- Authentication and authorisation with Devise and CanCan
- Email automation with Mailgun
- Image upload
- Category data sanitisation through search and filter feature

## Design documentation
Our design process is documented in our figma board
https://www.figma.com/file/CRzT3j3jkgBQlPhhWkpp2SnK/Rails-app?node-id=0%3A1

### Design process

The figma board:
* defines our user personas and user stories
* outlines our user journeys
* explores the user interfaces we like


From there we created our moodboard, colour scheme and wireframes.
