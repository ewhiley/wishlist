## Description of project

This section provides an outline of project, including the purpose, functionality and features.

### Problem definition / purpose

The purpose of this project was to build a two-sided marketplace in Ruby on Rails. 

We chose to create an eBay style app that solves some of the issues we identified with eBay. Below are some of the issues and the ways we sought to solve them with our app. 

Issues with eBay| Proposed solution with our app |
---------|----------|
 Buyers and sellers find it hard to find each other in a sea of products and users | We implemented a matching system that allows buyers to list what they want and be matched with available products as they come on sale. | 
 Ugly, difficult to use interface | We  tried to make our interface as simple and easy to use as possible| 
Buying and selling isn't always fast or seamless and can be quite annoying, especially for sellers | We simplified the buying process with a quick pay-by-card solution - no bidding or negotiating. |

### Functionality / features
Our app includes the following functionality/features:

Users can: 
- browse and purchase products
- sign in, set up a profile, edit profile
- list and edit products to sell, including image upload
- list a wishlist
- view their wishlist matches and purchase
- view their sales an purchase history

The app includes the following features:
- Secure payment with Stripe
- Authentication and authorisation with Devise and CanCan
- Email automation with Mailgun
- Image upload
- Category data sanitisation through search and filter feature

### Screenshots of Trello board(s)
We kept track of our tasks using trello (screenshot below)

Every morning, we had a team standup and updated the Trello board to reflet what we had done and what we were working on. We then reported our progress to the class standup.

## Design documentation
Our design process is documented in our figma board
https://www.figma.com/file/CRzT3j3jkgBQlPhhWkpp2SnK/Rails-app?node-id=0%3A1

### Design process
As the Figma board shows, we:
- identified our users and their needs
- created our user stories and journeys
- identified what our MVP would be 
- created our ERD 
- researched user interfaces for inspiration
- identified the various page types that needed to be wireframed
- created low fidelity wireframes for all page types (in different device sizes)
- created a moodboard based on our user stories and research
- created a range of colour palettes and font pairing based on our moodboard
- discussed and decided on a colour palette based on what would work best for our users, accessibility and design
- created a range of logos and decided on one as a team
- created high-fidelity wireframes using the chosen colour-palette and logo

## Short Answer Q&A - Include short answers to the following questions

### 1. What is the need (i.e. challenge) that you will be addressing in your project?

The purpose of this project was to build a two-sided marketplace in Ruby on Rails. We chose to create an eBay-style app called Wishlist. We identified a number of issues with the current eBay site and set the challenge to solve some of these issues with our app. 

The first challenge was to create an app that included many of the same features as eBay, including two different user types, authentication and authorisation of these two user types, ability to list and edit product details, image uploads, a payment system and an automated email system. 

The second challenge was to create some features and functionality that provides a solution to soe issues we identified with eBay, including difficulty matching buyers with sellers, difficult/ugly user interface, difficult/annoying selling process. 

### 2. Identify the problem you’re trying to solve by building this particular marketplace App? Why is it a problem that needs solving?

Our app provides a solution to some of the issues we identified with eBay. Below are some of the issues, the reasoning behind why they need to be solved, and the ways we attempted to solve them with our app. 

Issues with eBay| Reasons why the issue needs to be solved |Proposed solution with our app |
---------|----------|----------|
 Buyers and sellers find it hard to find each other in a sea of products and users | It's important buyers and sellers can find each other quickly and easily or they will choose to buy and sell on other platforms | We implemented a matching system that allows buyers to list what they want and be matched with available products as they come on sale. | 
 Ugly, difficult to use interface | It's important the interface is easy to use because otherwise, the matching system implemented above will be useless if users can't find it or can't use it | We tried to make our interface as simple and easy to use as possible| 
Buying and selling isn't always fast or seamless and can be quite annoying, especially for sellers | If sellers find the selling process annoying, they will choose to sell through other platforms. Without sellers there would be no products on the website | We simplified the buying process with a quick pay-by-card solution - no bidding or negotiating. |

### 3. Describe the project will you be conducting and how your App will address the needs.
